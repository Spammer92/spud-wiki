# #LetPearlSwear

Usually chat spams this hashtag when something they deem swear-worthy has happened on stream. This is just for fun and games, as Pearl is a family friendly streamer and she won't heed chat's plea to swear.

But accidents happen...

Like in a stream of The Quarry when she, while reading the game's text, she accidentally read a swear word. Chat of course noticed and thus #PearlFinallySwore was born.

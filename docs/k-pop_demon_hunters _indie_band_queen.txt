**"Have you seen K-Pop Demon Hunters?"** or **"Have you heard about the indie band called Queen?"** were recurring questions in the livestream chat on the 9th July 2025. At first people asked about K-Pop Demon Hunters{1} because they were curious if Pearl watched it and how she liked it, but later after multiple people asked this question not knowing someone else asked it prior, it became a joke among chatters to ask this question.

The question about the "indie" band <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)">Queen</a>{2} started appearing shortly after the fist time <span title="K-Pop Demon Hunters" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">KDH</span> was mentioned, when Pearl admitted she doesn't know many band names. As a result if someone asked about <span title="K-Pop Demon Hunters" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">KDH</span> another chatter would ask **"Have you heard about the indie band called Queen?"**.

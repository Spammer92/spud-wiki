# #LetPearlSwear

(Writtern by <span class="tw-name col-matty">Matty5957</span>)

Usually chat spams **#LetPearlSwear** when something they deem worthy of being cursed happens on stream. This is just for fun and games, as Pearl is a family friendly streamer and she will never heed our plea for her to swear.

But accidents happen...

Like in [this](https://youtu.be/Q8vN9HPjBjE?t=3440) (it's NSFW, obviously) stream of 'The Quarry' where, while reading the game's sentences, she accidentally said a swear word. Chat of course noticed and thus **#PearlFinallySwore**, another hashtag, was born.
